Hello!

----- 0 -- common ----------
- This program downloads wallpapers from http://wallheaven.cc using its api.

----- 1 -- help -------------
- this text is shown at first start of program
- also run program with -h or --help parameter to see this text

----- 2 -- parameters -------
- There are some parameters:
--- '-q', '--query': :phrase that used to search wallpapers
--- '-l', '--at-least': :minimum resolution of wallpaper
--- '-r', '--ratio': :needed ratio of wallpaper
--- '-p', '--path': :directory to save wallpapers in. Parent of this directory must exist
--- '-n', '--number-of-packages': :Wallpapers is downloaded by batches (packages). Size of one package - 24.
                                    - (Why? Because wallheaven.cc set this value as max query size)

----- 3 -- modes------------
- The program has two modes:
--- first - interactive:
------ program asks you for each parameter
------ start program with '-i' parameter to use this mode
--- second - parameterized:
------ use parameters from second paragraph, for example:
------ -q nature -l 1920x1080 -r 16x9 -p /home/alex/Wallpapers -n 5

----- 4 -- caching----------
- agree, it would not be good if you would have to enter each parameter again every time when
- you start the program. So each time when you enter any parameter, the program saves it.
- Next time, you can skip this parameter (in all modes), and the program will use saved data.
- But if you have never entered skipped parameter before, there will an error, so be careful with skipping.

----- 5 -- example----------
here is an example:

- error ---- image 4djkeo has wrong resolution(1366x768)! It will not be downloaded

- Number of minuses means number of wallpapers can't be loaded.
- Number of equals signs means number of wallpapers that are loading yet.

- message 'File xxxxxx.xxx already exist!' means you already have that file.
